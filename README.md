Code to turn on the Nepixel WS2812 LEDs of a 4x4 matrix one by one. When all the LEDs are on, they are all turned off and start again.
When the program starts, the LEDs light up white. With the three buttons you can change the color (RGB) of the LEDs at any time. If all three buttons are pressed at the same time, the LEDs will turn white again.
